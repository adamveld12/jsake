Yet another javascript build tool YAJSBT

This is just a guinea pig project and I don't expect this to take off. 
I just want an imperative and simple task runner in JS that doesn't need
plugins or other nonsense to use. Something that fits this bill probably
already exists, but it doesn't mean I can't give my own shot at it.

## How to build

### Setup
  1. `npm install`
  2. Run tests with `npm test`

## Use

TODO

## Contributing changes

Please feel free to open issues and pull requests. Everyone's code is welcome with open arms.

The workflow I would like to use is defined as follows:

master is _always_ stable. This means that active development happens on the development branch,
and pull requests will go there first. 

## License
  MIT license, feel free to do any horrible or fantastic thing you want with this code
